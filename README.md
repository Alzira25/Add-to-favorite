# Add-to-favorite

I have created Add to Favorite button in Details page. When the user select the product to see the details and click add to favorite button.
It takes to Favorite page to view the user's favorite products. But whenever the user come back to the same product details, the user
should not click the favorite button again or the button should disabled to let the user know that the products is already added to their
favorite page.
